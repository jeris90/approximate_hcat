# ARIPOTER-hcat: ARgumentatIon apPrOximaTE Reasoning using the h-Categorizer semantics

This tool can solve all the problems in the approximate track of [ICCMA 2023](https://iccma2023.github.io/)

## Building the tool


## Usage
ARIPOTER-hcat follows the instructions of ICCMA 2023. In particular, the command-line is as follows:
```text
usage: jarfile [-a <argument>] [-f <input_AF>] [-p <task>] [-problems]
 -a,--argument <argument>   Quary argument for credulous and skeptical
                            acceptance
 -f,--input_AF <input_AF>   Path of the file containing the AF.
 -p,--task <task>           <task> is a computational problem supported by
                            the solver (e.g. DC-CO, DS-PR).
 -problems,--problems       Prints the supported computational problems
                            and exits
```
